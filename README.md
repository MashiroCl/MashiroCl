### Hi there, I'm Lei Chen 👋

A goal-oriented and dedicated researcher and software engineer.

Finished the "Ph.D." tutorial level at **Institute of Science Tokyo**.
It took years, countless cups of coffee, and a lot of stack traces to earn the title, yet I still mostly rely on `print("here")` for debugging.
